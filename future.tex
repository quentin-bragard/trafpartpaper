\begin{itemize}
\item One of the limiting factor in this comparison is the limited representation of the road network. We plan to extend our model by allowing edges and vertices in our road network graph to have more than one weight associated with them. In doing so, we can allow for a finer and more accurate representation of the road network which in turn allows us to partition the graph better.
\item In the modified move function, we currently move edges(the neighbour correspoding to the edge) if it has a weight which is 2$\sigma$ away from $\mu$. This is under the assumption that traffic is normally distributed across the edges. One of the improvements that we could do is to fit the distribution of traffic across edges and move edges according to this regressively found curve that fits the traffic distribution.
